= find-dated

Find files based on the date in filename. The motivation behind this little script was that using `find . -mtime +14` to find more than 14 days old log files relies on the files' timestamps and it's not usually what I want. I'd rather rely on the date in the filename. With that in mind this script was created to resemble `find`: define how old or new a file needs to be and which directories to search.

== Usage

To see how to use:

```
./fdated.py -h
```

An example:
```sh
# note the file that doesn't have a date in it
$ ls logs
main-2018-04-20.log
main-2018-04-21.log
main-2018-04-22.log
main-2018-04-23.log
main-2018-04-24.log
main-2018-04-25.log
main-2018-04-26.log
main-2018-04-27.log
main-2018-04-28.log
main-2018-04-29.log
main-2018-04-30.log
notfound.log
# Define today as April 30 and find all files with a date in the filename in
# directory logs. Note that the file notfound.log isn't listed.
$ ./fdated.py -t 2018-04-30 logs/
